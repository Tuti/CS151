This is how they argue, as far as I can tell.
If they are right they argue the point, and they stay on point until you are down on your knees begging and apologizing for forgiveness. But if they are wrong they go rogue. 
They start thinking about shit you're sensitive about, and start concocting this evil statement. 
This desperate hail-Mary attempt is to make you so fucking mad, you call them a cunt. 
So the next time you're arguing with your wife, girlfriend, or whatever, and they start saying crazy shit, just know in that moment you have won the fight. 
Bob and weave the rest, don't get mad, stay in the pocket of the argument. The argument is over, you won, take a knee and run out the clock. 
So what they won't hook up with you for a few days, who cares. Take it like a man, rub one out. It's the champagne of victory.

My mother said to me, 'If you are a soldier, you will become a general. If you are a monk, you will become the Pope.' 
Instead, I was a painter, and became Picasso.
